                    <p>As you can see from the photo, I come from a <b>BIG</b> family. My parents were born in Mexico and they moved to Florida were they then decided to start their family. Since i was the last one born in my family, I was very privileged and spoiled according to my siblings. I never really felt what it was like to not have the necessities like some of my older siblings, but that was all thanks to my dad whenever he started his own company. <a href="http://www.primemastersinc.com/">Prime Masters</a> was founded in 2006 by my dad and my 2<sup>nd</sup> oldest brother, and they've been open and running ever since. After graduating in 2019, I decided to work for the family company, and thats where I fell in love with the concept of running a company and everything about money.</p>

                <p class="move">There are only 2 things in this world that I love doing, playing/watching soccer and playing video games. Every Sunday I go play soccer at a field thats south of where I live, its not a very competitive league but it gets very emotional and thats what makes it very enjoyable, especially whenever I score goals. My favorite club to watch though is Barcelona, they made me fall in love with the game of soccer the way they would dominate opponents. For video games, I usually stick to Call of Duty games, most of my friends I made through the years of playing stick to those type of games or battle royale games. </p>

               <h1>Coding Goals</h1>
               <p>In 2021 I had started to look into coding and I was very intrigued on what i had learned, I knew about coding, but I had never grasped how complex and fascinating it really was. As I looked more and more into it, I decided I wanted to learn how to code and make a career out of it. I know that later in the future techonology is going to be more impactful than it already is in our lives, and I want to be apart of that, I also want to learn as much as possible so that I can find ways to make the lives of people around me much easier. </p>
